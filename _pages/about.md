I am a PhD student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/electrical-engineering) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dionysis Kalogerias](https://www.dkalogerias.org/). My main research interests include but not limited to mathematical optimization, risk-aware decision-making & stochastic resouce allocation in wireless networks, distributionally robust optimization, and quantitative analysis.

Prior to Yale, I received my MS degree from [the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bogazici.edu.tr/) at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.bogazici.edu.tr/en_US), where I was a member of [Bogazici University Nanonetworking Research Group (NRG)](http://nrg.boun.edu.tr/), supervised by [Prof. Ali Emre Pusane](https://academics.boun.edu.tr/ali.pusane/). My research focus was molecular communication channel modeling and modulation schemes for multi-receiver systems. I received my BS degrees from [the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bogazici.edu.tr/) and [the Department of Physics](https://phys.bogazici.edu.tr/) at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.bogazici.edu.tr/).

Besides my academic endeavors, I am a hardcore [Fenerbahçe](https://www.fenerbahce.org/) fan, and rarely miss a game. I closely follow Formula 1 and several other motorsports, also I am a Rubik's cube enthusiast with a sub-30 personal record on 3x3. Recently, I've been interested in the hobby of horology, and trying to learn the niche craftsmanship of watchmaking.

You may find my academic genealogy [here](/assets/pdf/Academic_Genealogy.pdf).
