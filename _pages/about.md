<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://seas.yale.edu/departments/electrical-engineering">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/">Yale University</a>, where I am fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.dkalogerias.org/">Prof. Dionysis Kalogerias</a>. My main research interests include but not limited to mathematical optimization, risk-aware decision-making & stochastic resouce allocation in wireless networks, distributionally robust optimization, and quantitative analysis.

Prior to Yale, I received my MS degree from <a href="https://ee.bogazici.edu.tr/">the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.bogazici.edu.tr/en_US">Boğaziçi University</a>, where I was a member of <a href="http://nrg.boun.edu.tr/">Bogazici University Nanonetworking Research Group (NRG)</a>, supervised by <a href="https://academics.boun.edu.tr/ali.pusane/">Prof. Ali Emre Pusane</a>. My research focus was molecular communication channel modeling and modulation schemes for multi-receiver systems. I received my BS degrees from <a href="https://ee.bogazici.edu.tr/">the Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering</a> and <a href="https://phys.bogazici.edu.tr/">the Department of Physics</a> at <a href="https://www.bogazici.edu.tr/en_US">Boğaziçi University</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Besides my academic endeavors, I am a hardcore <a href="https://www.fenerbahce.org/">Fenerbahçe</a> fan, and rarely miss a game. I closely follow Formula 1 and several other motorsports, also I am a Rubik's cube enthusiast with a sub-30 personal record on 3x3. Recently, I've been interested in the hobby of horology, and trying to learn the niche craftsmanship of watchmaking.
